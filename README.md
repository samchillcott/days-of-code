# #days-of-code

Template for a less stressful version of the classic #100-days-of-code challenge.

# Motivation

After finishing the #100daysofcode challenge I wanted to continue doing something similar but without some of the pressures and commitments. 

# Rules

- Log what you learn each day using the log.md. Add the date, your progress, thoughts and questions. Commit to your repo.
- Do it any day you want to. You dont have to do it everyday or for a certain period of time. You decide. No pressure.

# Optional Rules
- Post on a social account usng the hashtag #daysofcode. Add the date of your session if you like eg. #daysofcode 19/7/20.
- Post using a video. This is a great way to practise your presentation and soft skills which can really help other areas of your life.
- Encourage others doing this challenge (by following the hashtag) or the original #100daysofcode. If you can, find the accounts with less of a following as opposed to the popular accounts who use the hashtags but aren't providing any value or even doing the challenge.

# Setup Instructions

- CLONE the repo rather than fork it. That way your commits will count as contributions to your GitHub account.
